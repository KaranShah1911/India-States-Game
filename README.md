This is a very useful tool for you, if you are not familiar with all the states of India and where are they located.

- After clicking run, a window will appear with India's map on it.
- It will ask you to input the name of the state.
- If the input state exists in India <strong>and</strong> the spelling is correct, then the name will go to that corresponding state.
- You can input the name in all lowercase alphabets.
- If you complete naming all the states, then a message will be displayed. This means you are through with the concepts ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª.
- If you are exhausted guessing the states, then just type <strong>exit</strong> in that window.

One of the interesting feature is that, after typing exit, a new file will be created with all the states name which you've missed. It will be a csv(Comma Seperated Values) file.
